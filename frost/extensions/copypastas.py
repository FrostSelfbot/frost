No one is going to be impressed and give you a high five (especially considering where that hand has been). I don’t want to add this to the rules, since it would be embarrassing for new users to see that we have a problem with this, but it is going to be enforced as a rule from now on.

I'll then proceed to leak your IP address onto my hacker forums, and then using an IP locator, I'll easily find your house and your name. With that I can access your social media accounts and proceed to ruin your life. You think I'm bluffing? You think that just because a bunch of 7 year olds say they can 'hack', but actually can't, that I can't either? Let me shatter that facade for you. Using my team of hackers, we can trace what websites you've visited and what keystrokes you've used, and with that, I can get into your parents' bank account. I can drain it and make you dirt poor. Have you ever felt what it's like to be homeless? Well, you're about to. I can also use cross-site scripting to redirect your web browser to one of my private sites, and download illegal files onto your computer and get your parents locked up in prison. I'm your worst nightmare, and I'm about to make you endure living Hell. I'm nowhere and everywhere at the same time. Have fun regretting your existence, kiddo.", delete_after=15)

This server is like a fucking mental ward, and you all need to seek help. It's always the same damn shit everyday, and nothing new ever comes out of anyone's shriveled brains. Where are all the dank memes? Where are all of the good jokes? Where is all the dark humour? All I see is the same fucking Tumblr screenshots, and it's honestly boring as fuck. ALL of you are boring as fuck, if I'm being frank. I have pity for your parents, because I wouldn't question how would I able to nurture someone so milquetoast and ignorant for 18 years without putting a bullet through my head. You're all lame as fuck. I feel more stupider interacting with you all, and I wouldn't want to spend another second in this toxic atmosphere. Hell I'm actually glad this group exists. It keeps all the unfunny pricks away from the server that appreciate quality in their content. I hope you all get drafted and never come back. I'm done with you assholes.", delete_after=17)

You used to say to be so mature but now you act childish, you also seem ungrateful but with that being said I still know you're a trustworthy person kinda also me and the others have really liked the peaceful server ever since you guys with your spamming and wanting to say the N word left(And then a few weeks later he decided to message him exactly at 12 am on his birthday)12:00 am November 6 aka your birthday, I memorized when your birthday was because before all this stuff happened I was planning something for your birthday but I guess that can't happen now, and no Birthday bot is gone so that didn't remind me, I may not be the person you want to hear this from but Happy Birthday dude, I hope this year is full of enjoyment and happiness for you, you deserve it 👍this is the least I can do")
